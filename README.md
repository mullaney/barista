JavaScript examples and explanations

I am currently learning JavaScript and I wanted to create a repository for things like:
* Solutions to problems from codewarrior, projecteulor.net, and other tutorials and books.
* Notes on how steps to take for specific tasks related to JavaScript.
* Posts exploring specific parts of JavaScript
* Alternate documentation for features of JavaScript written in non-technical ways in order to deepen my own understanding of particular projects.

This project is to document in depth my exploration of the JavaScript language. Included will be some of my solutions to algorithm problems from sites like codewars.com, projecteulor.net. I'll include functions that I've written which might be useful in other contexts. In addition, there will be links to blog posts and stackoverflow questions which I found particularly useful. And finally, I'll have posts which go into depth on various subjects. Since I'm still new to JavaScript, these posts will aim to be in depth, but simple enough for a beginner to understand.

The repository for this blog can be found at [github.com/mullaney](https://github.com/mullaney/barista).
